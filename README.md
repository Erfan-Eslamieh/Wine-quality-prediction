# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

Wine quality prediction is a crucial task in the wine industry as it helps **producers**, **sellers**, and **consumers** make informed decisions based on the wine's characteristics. This project aims to build **machine learning models** that predict wine quality using various **physicochemical features** such as acidity, alcohol content, pH level, and sulfur dioxide concentration.

We explore and compare the performance of different ML algorithms including **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests**, evaluating their ability to classify wine quality accurately.

## 📊 Column Descriptions

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `fixed acidity`        | Natural acids in wine (e.g., tartaric, malic) |
| `volatile acidity`     | Vinegar-like smell in wine |
| `citric acid`          | Enhances freshness and flavor |
| `residual sugar`       | Sugar remaining after fermentation |
| `chlorides`            | Salt content in wine |
| `free sulfur dioxide`  | Protects wine from oxidation and spoilage |
| `total sulfur dioxide` | Combined free and bound SO2 |
| `density`              | Weight per unit volume |
| `pH`                   | Acidity or alkalinity level |
| `sulphates`            | Added to preserve wine quality |
| `alcohol`              | Ethanol concentration in wine |
| `quality`              | Wine quality score (target variable) |

## 💡 Insights & Applications

- Higher **alcohol levels** generally correlate with better wine quality.
- Lower **volatile acidity** contributes to a more pleasant aroma and thus higher ratings.
- Wines with balanced **pH**, **sulphates**, and **citric acid** levels tend to perform better in terms of taste and shelf life.
- **PCA** can reduce feature complexity while preserving essential information for classification.
